    {A signalling game.
    In cooperative settings, \textbf{Sender} and \textbf{Receiver} must collaborate to achieve a shared payoff at the \textbf{Target}.
    Whether the receiver obtains a payoff depends on its own act (node not shown) and the value of \textbf{State}.
    Since only the sender has access to the state, it must guide the receiver with a \textbf{Signal}.
    Here, the State plays both roles that teleosemantics distinguishes as Proximate and Distal States (see figure \ref{fig:teleo}).
    See also \citet{martinez2019deception} for the close formal links between communication theory and signalling games.
