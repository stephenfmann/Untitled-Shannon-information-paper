## The dialectic of the paper

The orthodox claim I argue to be false:

> The only relevance of communication theory for philosophical theories of semantic content is measures of correlation.

Martinez has previously argued that this claim is false.
Here I lend further support to his position.

### The orthodox family of views

Naturalising representational content is a popular project.
The family of views that characterise the current state of the art derive from the orthodox claim.
They derive very different consequences from it, however.
Here is a non-exhaustive list:

+ Correlations just are relationships of semantic content. (Skyrms, Isaac)
+ Correlations must be supplemented with something else (e.g. function) to define semantic content. (Shea)
+ Correlations can be supplemented with something else (e.g. function) to define relationships that are relevant for explanation of cognitive and biological capacities, but those relationships are not semantic content. (Lean, Hutto & Myin)
+ Correlations are insufficient for explaining cognitive and biological capacities because correlation is too broad a relationship to do the requisite explanatory work (Owren, Rendall and Ryan).

+ [TODO: Gallistel, Milkowski, Artiga...]

### Martinez's view

Martinez holds an unorthodox position:

> Communication theory has more relevance for philosophical theories of semantic content than just measures of correlation.

This would change the game (etc, etc)...

### Dialectic of this paper.

Martinez offers positive arguments in defence of his claim:

> **P**: Communication theory has more relevance for philosophical theories of semantic content than just measures of correlation.

But the orthodox claim, not-P, appears to be supported by two very strong positive arguments of its own:

> **not-P**: Communication theory has more relevance for philosophical theories of semantic content than just measures of correlation.

Here I undercut those arguments for not-P.
Together with Martinez's positive arguments for P, my arguments against not-P provide substantive reason to endorse P and thus change the rules of the game for naturalising representation content (etc, etc)...
