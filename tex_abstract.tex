\noindent Manolo Mart\'{i}nez has recently advocated using communication theory to understand cognitive representations. However, prominent views about naturalistic intentionality share a premise challenging the very possibility of Mart\'{i}nez's project: that the only relevance communication theory could have is via measures of correlation. Here I challenge that premise by rejecting two common misconceptions: that Claude Shannon said that the meanings of signals are irrelevant for communication theory (he didn't and they aren't), and that since correlations can't distinguish signals and cues, communication theory can't distinguish them either (the premise is true but the argument is invalid). Overall the path is cleared for Mart\'{i}nez's positive project.
