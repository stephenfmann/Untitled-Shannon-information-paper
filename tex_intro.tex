\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Communication theory measures the costs and benefits of representation, and describes how to trade them off judiciously. 
This fact has been obscured by prominent scepticism about the relevance of mathematical formalism for naturalist theories of representation. 

In this paper I describe and undercut two popular justifications for that scepticism.
We are left with a view of communication theory that recommends fully integrating it with naturalist representation. 
The most suitable existing account is teleosemantics, which should be viewed as a generalisation of communication theory beyond the paradigm of binary digits and electrical signals upon which it was founded.
